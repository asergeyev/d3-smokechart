SmokeChart: SmokePing-like charts for d3.js

YOU ARE WELCOME TO HELP!

This library is currently in state of "I have an idea". It likely needs a facelift
and more d3-like interface.


BASIC USAGE

  var smoke = new SmokeChart('#mydiv',width,height,x_value_count,max_y_value);
  smoke.addLine('traffic', mydata, "#900", "#999")
       .addGuide('zero', 0, '#000')
       .addGuide('capacity', 160000, '#f00')
       .showLabels(['6:00', '12:00', '18:00', '0:00']);

Idea is simple: ask for a chart, put some lines, labels and guidelines. You may also 
dynamically change your chart content using functions described in API reference.

FUTURE

* I'd like to make charts less of "functional programming" and more similar to
  other d3 libs, as described in http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/
* Some inheritance from time-series chart or another existing component would
  be nice to have http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/time-series-chart.js
